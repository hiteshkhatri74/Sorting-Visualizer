A JavaScript Sorting Visualizer provides a visual representation of sorting algorithms like
Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. It displays how elements are sorted step-by-step, making complex algorithms
easier to understand. Users can observe the sorting process dynamically, highlighting the efficiency and behavior of
each algorithm visually.
